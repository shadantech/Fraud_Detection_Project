## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using Python. Fraud transactions are extremely rare, making the dataset highly imbalanced. This project demonstrates the use of **unsupervised anomaly detection techniques** to identify fraud patterns and visualize anomalies for better interpretability.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python 3.11  
- **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn (Isolation Forest, PCA)  
- **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow / Keras (Autoencoder)  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook, VS Code  
- **Version Control:** Git / GitHub

---

## Dataset

The project uses the **Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset** from Kaggle:

- Source: [Kaggle – Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- Number of transactions: 284,807
- Features: 
  - `Time` – seconds elapsed between transactions
  - `Amount` – transaction amount
  - `V1` to `V28` – anonymized PCA features
  - `Class` – target variable (0 = Normal, 1 = Fraud)
- Fraud cases: 492 (~0.17%)

---

## Models Used

### 1. Isolation Forest
- Isolation Forest Recall (Fraud): 0.82
- Unsupervised tree-based anomaly detection algorithm
- Isolates outliers by partitioning data using random trees
- Flags transactions as anomalies (fraud) without using class labels

### 2. Autoencoder
- Autoencoder Precision (Fraud): 0.91
- Neural network-based unsupervised model
- Learns to reconstruct normal transaction patterns
- Transactions with **high reconstruction error** are flagged as fraud

---

## Data Preprocessing

- Scaled `Amount` and `Time` features using `StandardScaler`
- Kept PCA features (V1–V28) as-is
- Prepared feature matrix `X` and target vector `y`
- Trained models using only normal transactions for unsupervised learning

---

## Evaluation Results

- Evaluated using **confusion matrix** and **classification report**
- Key metric focus: **Recall for fraud class** (class 1)
- Isolation Forest detected anomalies effectively, Autoencoder showed higher precision in reconstructing normal patterns
- Both models handle highly imbalanced datasets without oversampling
